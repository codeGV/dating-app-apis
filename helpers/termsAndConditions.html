<p><br />(i) enabling us to process your application for membership and enabling us to provide services to you
    (including creating your publicly viewable profile, allowing members to search for suitable members and providing
    mechanisms for communication between members);<br />(ii) our internal research and statistical purposes (including

    purpose (unless that business purpose has been specifically referred to in this Privacy Statement).</p>
<p><br />(c) Use and disclosure of Personal Data</p>
<p><br />Use of Personal Data for the Primary Purpose will include the use of Personal Data in automated decision-making
    processes.</p>
<p><br />We will only use or disclose Personal Data about you for a purpose other than the Primary Purpose (being a
    "Secondary Purpose") where the following apply:</p>
<p><br />(i) the Secondary Purpose is related to the Primary Purpose and, if the Personal Data is Special Category

    expect us to use or disclose the Personal Data for the Secondary Purpose; or<br />(iii) you have consented to the

    authorized under law, regulation or court order.</p>

    other Personal Data) to third parties, such as Facebook, in order to better target our advertising to you, by using
    products such as Facebook's Custom Audiences.</p>
<p><br />A comparison of your hashed email address will only be for the purpose of promoting our goods and services to
    you and will not be used by that third party for any other purpose. The comparison of the hash of your email address
    will not be used to identify you or your email address, and no further information about you will be provided by us
    to that third party.</p>
<p>You may withdraw your consent to our use of your Personal Data for the Primary and Secondary Purposes at any time by

</p>
<p><br />(i) misuse, interference, and loss; and<br />(ii) unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.</p>
<p><br />In the unlikely event that there is a serious data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and
    freedoms, we will without undue delay notify the appropriate supervisory authority in your jurisdiction. Where there
    is a high risk that a serious data breach will impact upon your rights and freedoms, we will also notify you of that
    breach.</p>
<p><br />(e) Overseas disclosures</p>
<p><br />Any profile information that you have provided to us will be publicly viewable on your profile, irrespective of
    the location of the viewer. By creating a profile you acknowledge that overseas recipients will be able to view your

    other than your country of residence) to access your profile information, billing information or other Personal Data
    that you have supplied.</p>
<p><br />We have implemented security measures to protect the security of your Personal Data. However, as with any
    transfer of data, there are still risks of data breaches. There may be instances where your Personal Data is
    transferred to third party countries and international organizations, which have not been the subject of an adequacy 
    decision by the General Data Protection Regulation Commission, or a ruling by the equivalent supervisory authority 
    in your jurisdiction. Such transfers are necessary in order for us to perform our obligations set out in the Mr & Mrs Terms 
    of Use and for us to deliver our services to you.</p>
<p>By providing your Personal Data and Special Category Personal Data you are explicitly consenting to the international
    transfer and processing of such data in accordance with this Privacy Statement, in full and informed knowledge of
    the risks associated with such transfers and processing.</p>

    Organization if the disclosure of the information is required or authorized by law, regulation or court order.</p>
<p><br />(f) Unsolicited information</p>
<p><br />If we collect Personal Data which we have not sought or requested about you, and if we determine we are legally 
    permitted to collect that information, we will deal with that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy 
    Statement. In all other circumstances, we will destroy or de-identify the relevant Personal Data as soon as practicable, 
    where it is lawful and reasonable to do so.

    request that they do the same.</p>
